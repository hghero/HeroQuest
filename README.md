# HeroQuest
An open source C++ implementation of the well-known board game for Windows!

This project has been started already in 2012. My first approach was to use the Allegro engine.
When it came to implementing dialogs, however, I realized that Allegro was not mighty enough, so
I decided to switch to Qt.

As I don't have much time to push this project, progress is being made very slowly only.

Currently only the first two levels are playable.

# Work and compile
- development: Eclipse CDT
- compile and link: Visual Studio 2010 compiler and linker (used only from the command line) 
- I use my own Makefile for compilation and stuff.
